# APCS Class Work

This repository contains everything I've ever written for the first-year AP Computer Science I took during the 2014-2015 school year. It mostly exists for historical reasons now. It will probably never be updated ever again.

I learned a lot from this class, and I want to urge anyone reading this that the code in this repository is most likely **not** good code. **Do not take anything in this repository and assume that it was built in a coherent way.** If you have any doubts about things, consult your preferred [Java style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
